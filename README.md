Are you looking for a secure and customisable note-taking app? Look no further than noteDown! This powerful app uses Markdown to format and style your notes to your liking, making organisation and readability a breeze. But what sets noteDown apart from other note-taking apps?

Firstly, noteDown requires users to authenticate themselves using their GitHub account login and password. This is because the app utilises GitHub APIs to create a private repository in the user's account, ensuring that their notes are stored securely. In addition, noteDown does not store any personal information in its own databases, prioritising user privacy at all times.

But noteDown is not just a secure app - it's also fully customisable. As an open source app, it can be tailored to suit individual needs, making it a versatile tool for anyone looking for a personalised note-taking experience.

In summary, noteDown is a powerful, secure, and customisable note-taking app that prioritises user privacy. With its use of Markdown, it's easy to organise and present information in a way that suits you. So why not give noteDown a try and see how it can improve your note-taking experience?
